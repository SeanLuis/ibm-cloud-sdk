# IBM Cloud SDK for PHP

The IBM Cloud SDK for PHP is a library that provides an easy way to interact with IBM Cloud services from applications
written in PHP. The SDK currently supports IBM NLU and IBM COS.

It is important to ensure that the required PHP extensions are enabled in the server environment. The SDK also requires
access to the IBM Cloud services that it is interacting with, such as IBM Cloud Object Storage and IBM Watson Natural
Language Understanding.

Note that the composer package manager will automatically install all the required dependencies and their dependencies
during installation of the SDK.

### Installation

To install the SDK, you can use Composer. If you don't already have Composer installed on your system, follow the
instructions at https://getcomposer.org to install it.

**Run the following command in your terminal to install the SDK:**

```CMD 
composer require sean-luis/ibm-php-sdk
```

### Setting

Before using the **SDK**, you must set up your **IBM Cloud credentials**. You can do it by creating a **YAML** file
or **ENV** file in the root directory of your project with the following keys

```YAML
ibm:
    api_key: "<IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY>"
    url: "<IBM_CLOUD_URL>"

nlu:
    api_key: "<IBM_NLU_API_KEY>"
    url: "<IBM_NLU_URL>"
    version: "<IBM_NLU_VERSION>"

cos:
    api_key: "<IBM_COS_API_KEY>"
    url: "<IBM_COS_URL>"
    region: "<IBM_COS_REGION>"
    bucket: "<IBM_COS_BUCKET>"
    instance_id: "<IBM_COS_INSTANCE_ID>"

tts:
    api_key: "<IBM_TTS_API_KEY>"
    url: "<IBM_TTS_URL>"
    version: "<IBM_TTS_VERSION>"
    
stt:
    api_key: "<IBM_STT_API_KEY>"
    url: "<IBM_STT_URL>"
    version: "<IBM_STT_VERSION>"
```

Or you can use **ENV**:

```dotenv
IBM_NLU_API_KEY=<IBM_NLU_API_KEY>
IBM_NLU_URL=<IBM_NLU_URL>
IBM_NLU_VERSION=<IBM_NLU_VERSION>

IBM_COS_API_KEY=<IBM_COS_API_KEY>
IBM_COS_URL=<IBM_COS_URL>
IBM_COS_REGION=<IBM_COS_REGION>
IBM_COS_BUCKET=<IBM_COS_BUCKET>
IBM_COS_REFERENCE_SERCICE_ID=<IBM_COS_INSTANCE_ID>

IBM_TTS_API_KEY=<IBM_TTS_API_KEY>
IBM_TTS_URL=<IBM_TTS_URL>
IBM_TTS_VERSION=<IBM_TTS_VERSION>

IBM_STT_API_KEY=<IBM_STT_API_KEY>
IBM_STT_URL=<IBM_STT_URL>
IBM_STT_VERSION=<IBM_STT_VERSION>

IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY=<IBM_CLOUD_APIKEY>
IBM_CLOUD_URL=<IBM_CLOUD_URL>
```

Replace the variables you think you'll use in each case you see fit with your own IBM Cloud credentials.

$token = $authenticator->getAccessToken();

// Create an instance of NaturalLanguageUnderstanding
$nlu = new NaturalLanguageUnderstanding($token, $url, $version);

// Define the text to analyze
$text = "I am very happy with the result of today's game.";

// Define your feature options for text analysis
$options = [
    'entities' => [

        'document' => true,
    ],
    'categories' => [
        'limit' => 5,
    ],
];

// Instantiate NLUFeaturesParams with custom options
$nluFeaturesParams = new NLUFeaturesParams($options);

// Make the request to IBM NLU
$response = $nlu->analyze($text, $features);

// Print the results

## Running Tests

**1. To run the tests for the IBM Cloud services implemented in this project, follow the steps below:**

* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Install the necessary dependencies by running composer install.
* Create a .env or .yaml (in case of yaml you must respect the name (**ibm-cloud.yaml**) file in the root directory of
  the project, and add environment variables

**2. Run the tests for all services using the following command:**

```
vendor/bin/phpunit ./tests
```

**3. Replace ServiceName with the name of the service you want to test, i.e. COS, NLU, TTS, or STT.**

```
vendor/bin/phpunit ./tests/ SERVICE / TEST_CLASS
```

This will run the tests for the IBM Cloud Object Storage service.

**4. If all tests pass, you should see a message similar to the following:**

```
OK (XX tests, XX assertions)
```

If any tests fail, you will see an error message indicating the reason for the failure.

Note: Some tests may fail if you do not have the necessary credentials or permissions to access certain resources on
your IBM Cloud account.

## Frequent questions

**How can I get IBM Cloud credentials?**

You can get IBM Cloud credentials from the IBM Cloud control panel. See the IBM Cloud documentation for more
information.

**How can I fix authentication errors?**

Make sure that the IBM Cloud credentials are correct and that they are set up correctly in the YAML or ENV file. You can
also try regenerating the credentials and reconfiguring them.

**How can I report bugs or request new features?**

You can report bugs or request new features in the SDK GitHub repository. See the "Contribute" section in the SDK
README.md file for more information.

## Contribute

If you want to contribute to the development of the SDK, you can do so in several ways:

If you find bugs or problems, you can report them on the SDK GitHub repository. If you want to request new features or
enhancements, you can also do so in the SDK GitHub repository. If you want to fix bugs or add new features, you can fork
the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
Before committing any changes, make sure that you have created proper unit and integration tests for your changes and
that the documentation has been updated accordingly.

## Conclusion

The IBM Cloud SDK for PHP is a useful tool for interacting with IBM Cloud services from applications written in PHP.
With the proper installation and configuration instructions, end users can use the SDK to interact with IBM NLU and IBM
COS. Clear and complete documentation, along with use cases and integration tests, will help end users to use the SDK
correctly and reduce the number of support questions. Additionally, the ability to contribute to the development of the
SDK makes it a useful and flexible tool for any project that uses the IBM Cloud.
